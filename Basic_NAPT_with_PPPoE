!! This sample configuration file is provided for convenience of and with wishes of
!! luck for those who are just starting to fiddle with their first Cisco ISR router.
!! Most Cisco routers do not have any presets like default LAN address and configured
!! DHCP, I imagine that many people (like I was once one of them) would find it rather
!! difficult to get starter with. I struggled get myself online with the first ISR1812J.
!! Well, being honest, it took me 3-5yrs to finally realize Cisco boxes and boxes of
!! other competing brands were far richer in functionality that the best friends of
!! mine at the time - YAMAHA RTX series - more appropriately seemed like options 
!! "for professional-gear newbies". I'm not saying YAMAHAs are bad - they make excellent
!! routers and the one I am most dependent on at home to this day is a RTX3000...but
!! occasioonally there are situations where those boxes just do not meet my needs.
!! Sometimes, maybe a Cisco box to satisfy that need, maybe it's a VyOS or EdgeMAX box 
!! at other times. Different vendors have different philosophies to dectate the 
!! characteristics of products - therefore, being familiar with as many different 
!! platforms as possible is always a good option as doing so will leave you with more
!! potential solutions.
!! Anyway, enough talking - let's get to the config!
